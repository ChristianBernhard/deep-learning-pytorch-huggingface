    "# Fine-Tune Llama 3.1 405B on a single Node with PyTorch FSDP and Q-LoRA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The release of [Llama 3.1 405B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B) marks a significant change in the landscape of large language models, setting a new benchmark for performance in general knowledge, reasoning, and multilingual tasks. As Meta's largest open-source model, Llama 3.1 405B competes directly with proprietary models like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, offering frontier-level capabilities at a more accessible price point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post will guide you through the process of fine-tuning Llama 3.1 405B using PyTorch FSDP and Q-LoRA, supported by Hugging Face's [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index), [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), [peft](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index) & [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index). We will also integrate [Flash Attention v2](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) for enhanced performance.\n",

    "2. **Create and prepare the dataset**\n",
    "3. **Fine-tune the LLM with PyTorch FSDP, Q-LoRA, and SDPA**\n",
    "4. **Test Model and run Inference**\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: This example is optimized for NVIDIA H100 and A100 GPUs. Adjustments can be made for different hardware configurations._ \n",
    "\n",
    "**Background on FSDP and Q-LoRA**\n",
    "\n",
    "FSDP enables efficient model sharding across GPUs, allowing the training of large models like Llama 3.1 405B. Q-LoRA reduces computational and memory requirements by combining quantization and low-rank adaptation. This collaboration between [Answer.AI](https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-03-06-fsdp-qlora.html), [Tim Dettmers](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes), and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on these techniques, refer to the following resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [PyTorch FSDP](https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-pytorch-fully-sharded-data-parallel-api/) is a data/model parallelism technique that shards model across GPUs, reducing memory requirements and enabling the training of larger models more efficiently​​​​​​.\n",
    "* Q-LoRA is a fine-tuning method that leverages quantization and Low-Rank Adapters to efficiently reduced computational requirements and memory footprint. \n"

Meaning if want would like to use them for the template we need to train them which requires more memory, since we need to update the embedding layer and lm_head.
