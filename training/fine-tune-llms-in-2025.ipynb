    "# How to fine-tune open LLMs in 2025 with Hugging Face\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) continued their important role in 2024, with several major developments completely outperforming previous models. The focus continued to more smaller, more powerful models from companies like Meta, Qwen, or Google. These models not only became more powerful, but also more efficient. We got Llama models as small as 1B parameters outperforming Llama 2 13B. \n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can now handle many tasks out-of-the-box through prompting, including chatbots, question answering, and summarization. However, for specialized applications requiring high accuracy or domain expertise, fine-tuning remains a powerful approach to achieve higher quality results than prompting alone, reduce costs by training smaller, more efficient models, and ensure reliability and consistency for specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to last years guide [How to Fine-Tune LLMs in 2024 with Hugging Face](https://www.philschmid.de/fine-tune-llms-in-2024-with-trl) this guide focuses more on optimization, distributed training and being more customizable. This means support for different PEFT methods from Full-Finetuning to QLoRA and Spectrum, optimizations for faster and more efficient training, with Flash Attention or Tiger Kernels and how to scale training to multiple GPUs using DeepSpeed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide is created using a script rather than notebook. If you are compeltely new to fine-tuning LLMs, I recommend you to start with the [How to Fine-Tune LLMs in 2024 with Hugging Face](https://www.philschmid.de/fine-tune-llms-in-2024-with-trl) guide and then come back to this guide. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to:\n",
    "1. Define a good use case for fine-tuning\n",
    "2. Setup the development environment\n",
    "3. Create and prepare the dataset\n",
    "4. Fine-tune the model using `trl` and the `SFTTrainer`\n",
    "5. Test and evaluate the model using `lighteval`\n",
    "6. Deploy the model in to a production environment\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: This guide is designed for consumer GPUs (24GB+) like the NVIDIA RTX 4090/5090 or A10G, but can be adapted for larger systems._\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Define a good use case for fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Open LLMs became more powerful and smaller in 2024. This often could mean fine-tuning might not be the first choice to solve your problem. Before you think about fine-tuning, you should always evaluate if prompting or already fine-tuned models can solve your problem. Create an evaluation setup and compare the performance of existing open models. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, fine-tuning can be particularly valuable in several scenarios. When you need to:\n",
    "- Consistently improve performance on a specific set of tasks\n",
    "- Control the style and format of model outputs (e.g., enforcing a company's tone of voice)\n",
    "- Teach the model domain-specific knowledge or terminology\n",
    "- Reduce hallucinations for critical applications\n",
    "- Optimize for latency by creating smaller, specialized models\n",
    "- Ensure consistent adherence to specific guidelines or constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we are going to use the following use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We want to fine-tune a model, which can solve high-school math problems to teach students how to solve math problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be a good use case for fine-tuning, as it requires a lot of domain-specific knowledge about math and how to solve math problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: This is a made-up example, as existing open models already can solve this task._"

    "We are now ready to fine-tune our model. We will use the [SFTTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/sft_trainer) from `trl` to fine-tune our model. The `SFTTrainer` makes it straightfoward to supervise fine-tune open LLMs. The `SFTTrainer` is a subclass of the `Trainer` from the `transformers` library and supports all the same features, including logging, evaluation, and checkpointing, but adds additiional quality of life features, including:\n",

    "* Packing datasets for more efficient training\n",
    "* PEFT (parameter-efficient fine-tuning) support including Q-LoRA, or Spectrum\n",
    "* Preparing the model and tokenizer for conversational fine-tuning (e.g. adding special tokens)\n",
    "* distributed training with `accelerate` and FSDP/DeepSpeed\n",
    "\n",
    "We prepared a [run_sft.py](./scripts/run_sft.py) scripts, which supports providing a yaml configuration file to run the fine-tuning. This allows you to easily change the model, dataset, hyperparameters, and other settings. This is done by using the `TrlParser`, which parses the yaml file and converts it into the `TrainingArguments` arguments. That way we can support Q-LoRA, Spectrum, and other PEFT methods with the same script. See Appendix A for execution examples for different models and PEFT methods and distributed training.\n",

This will give you a better understanding of the inner workings of the framework and how it can be customized. Especially when you ran into an issue or want to extend the scripts and add new features. Axolotl is used by many open source builders and is well tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start our training lets take a look at our [training script](./scripts/run_sft.py). The script is kept very simple and is easy to understand. This should help you understand, customize and extend the script for your own use case. We define `dataclasses` for our arguments. Every argument can then be provided either via the command line or by providing a yaml configuration file. That way we have better type safety and intellisense support.\n",
